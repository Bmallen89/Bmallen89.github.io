          <p class="sum itemfull">Once the sketches were complete they were turned into Digital Wireframes and used for used for Usability tests.
            The usability tests were to establish whether the user was able to do three essential functions:
            Sign up for an account, create a collaborative document, and move a file into a folder.
            Success was not determined by completion of the scenarios, but getting a better understanding of the user’s struggles.</p>

            <p>The homepage was a positive experience for the users.
              They were quickly able to sort through the onboarding process and felt very comfortable with the information and layout of the page.
              Users were easily able to identify the type of program the website was for as well as appreciating the details provided.</p>

              There was a need to make the navigation aspects more familiar to the user.
              I spent time looking back at my wireframe sketches to see what changes needed to be made before putting the details into the Mockups.</p>

            and click create a new Sky Document. With the original iteration of the wireframe it was obvious the New button needed to stand out more.
            Uploading and creating new content is at the top of the priority list, and is the key to the site’s functionality. I also realized the need to remove scope creep.
            In this iteration, there was connections to SkyDrive itself, Google Docs, and Microsoft office, each with the ability to create a word processing document, spreadsheet, and slidedecks.
            I realized that as much as the connectivity was nice, it was not a top priority. I would need to redesign the element to be more straight forward.</p>

            <p class="itemfull text">After reviewing the research, a significant amount of detail was available to assist moving forward. Using mind mapping and word lists,
            I was able to take the key ideas from my user interactions to find a name and logo that felt on target with our goal.</p>

          <p class="item1-7">With the basic sketches and word association in mind, a mood board was created to get the feel of our product.
            The name SkyDrive felt on brand with our goal. When you break down the words, Sky representing the cloud in which users are storing their data,
            and Drive representing not only the idea of a hard drive but also speed. I gravitated towards simple geometric shapes and patterns, as well as images of the sky itself.
            Shades of blue, pink, and gray seemed to line up with all of the images that inspired me. When picking a brand typeface all of the patterns in the mood board pointed to a geometric type.</p>
          <img class="item7-13" src="casestudies/skydrive/images/moodboard.jpg" alt="Moodboard">
          <p class="item1-7">After reviewing the moodboard, the colors that stood out were a dark blue, light blue, tan, pink, and black.
          These colors not only lined up with the theme of sky, but also represented the brand characteristics. The shades of blue represent a sense of trust, stability, and safety, while the pink gives contrast and a feel of expessiveness and speed.
          I had to make sure not to use too much pink or the design might feel too playful. The neutral tan, black, and greys would give a calm, empathetic feel while also being easy on the eye.  </p>
          <img class="item7-13" src="casestudies/skydrive/images/colors.jpg" alt="Colors">
          <p class="item1-7">Poppins was selected for its large variety of weights, its style has a feel that unites well with reliability and speed.
            PT Serif was chosen as the body typeface because of its detail and readability. This allows for the user to quickly and simply read information and allow for a stress-free environment.
            The combination of the two typefaces allows the user to clearly see hierarchy and make decisions rapidly. </p>

          <p class="item1-7">When refining the logo, the simple geometric shapes came back into play. Along with the name I wanted a simple detail to relate back to the user research and the top priority of security.
            After ideating on ways to place a lock multiple variations of the logo were formed. The first iteration of our logo was born.
            Though I wanted to keep with simplicity and basic shapes, the logo needed a pattern to really stand out.
            A square and rectangle were joined to create the inner lock mechanism and creating the final logo. </p>

          <p class="itemfull text">With all branding information near completion, a style guide was created for future reference.
            All rules from logos and iconography to colors and typeface were presented with key examples to give future designers the proper tools to succeed.

            The user feedback taken from the initial usability test was helpful to see the initial flaws and correct the necessary details.
            When needed, I reflected back on the original sketches to find inspiration for modifications to the prototypes.
            The desktop prototype was created first and used as a model for the mobile application.
            I made sure the mobile version was not just a watered-down, bare-minimum adaptation but a fully-functional experience.
            My goal was and is for the user to feel just as comfortable using the mobile app as the desktop. </p>

            <p class="text none">A second round of usability tests were conducted to test both desktop and mobile prototypes.
              I included a participant that titled herself &quot;not tech-savvy&quot; to see how someone who was not familiar with cloud storage would interact with the applications.
              More edits were made based on the tests as well as my observation of the experiences.
              SkyDrive is always evolving, ways to improve the design for better user experience should always be kept in the front of the designer’s mind.
              The devil is always in the details, and will make our project what stands out from its competition.</p>

          <h2 class="itemfull">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="itemfull text">SkyDrive is a product that built itself. From the initial research to its current iteration, SkyDrive has been focused on security and speed.
            After each step of the process, the design seemed to find the next step to layer on the details of what this product is really about.
            Focusing on user feedback was incredibly helpful to finding out what functioned as intended, and what needed work.
            Although some aspects of first drafts were not effective, the feedback and observation was used to find the proper design.
            Avoiding scope creep was a bit of a struggle at times, but when re-evaluating and remembering Pareto’s Principle helped streamline the project to be a success. <br> <br>
            At first glance, creating another cloud storage and organization competitor seemed like a daunting task.
            Taking the time to assess the competition as well as hear what the users had to say, it quickly became apparent what this project could become.
            The biggest lesson learned from this project was letting the users and data illustrate the design instead of preconceived notions. All of the information learned helped me become a better designer.
            My future experience and future designs will be crafted based on the product as a whole instead of each individual feature. When you become too feature focused it’s easy to miss how everything fits into the larger user experience.</p>
